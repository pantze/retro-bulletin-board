# Public Assets Documentation

This directory contains public assets for the Node.js web server project. 

## Overview

The public folder is intended to hold static files that can be served directly to clients. This includes any HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, or other files that are necessary for the front-end of the application.

## Usage

- Ensure that any static files you want to serve are placed in this directory.
- The server is configured to serve files from this directory, allowing users to access them via their web browsers.

## Directory Listing

The server provides a directory listing feature, which allows users to view all files available in the public directory. This can be useful for navigating and downloading files directly.

## File Downloads

Users can download files from this directory by clicking on the file links provided in the directory listing. The server handles the download process, ensuring that files are served correctly.
